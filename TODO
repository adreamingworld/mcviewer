[ ] cast_ray still crashes, when we go tout of the map to the west
	then head directly back in directly along the x axis
	it seems to crash/hang

[ ] When we change blocks we need to rebuild surrounding chunks
	if changed block was on a boundary of a chunk!
[ ] Ray cast should maybe return coordinates?
	then we can see from the current position and the
	position hit which face of the block was hit
