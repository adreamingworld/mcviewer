[x] Use Opengl 3.3
	[X] shaders
		[X] Projection + ModelView Matrix

[ ] Tidy up
	[ ] 3D maths
	[ ] map building
	[ ] Utilities like picking etc still in main.c?

[ ] Ambient occlusion
	https://0fps.net/2013/07/03/ambient-occlusion-for-minecraft-like-worlds/
	use color attribute to shade. turn lighting off?
	or it can complement the lighting
	[ ] Take into account which face it is!
	My ambient occlusion only takes into account the vertex
	Infact depending on the face the blocks needed to
	be checked also change!!!! Think about it

[X] When we change blocks we need to rebuild surrounding chunks
	if changed block was on a boundary of a chunk!

[ ] Rebuild chunks
	[ ] geometry needs to be destroyed, memory freed etc!!!

[ ] Collision detection
	[ ] render character
	[ ] fall untill raycast detects ground
